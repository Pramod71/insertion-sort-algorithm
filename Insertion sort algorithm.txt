Insertion sort

Step0:start
Step1:Declare an array of size, n.
Step2:Provide the n inputs such that the array (named arr) is unsorted.
Step3:Run a loop, with i from 0 to n-1
Step4:Assign arr[i] as key and i-1 as j
Step5:While j >= 0 and arr[j+1] > arr[j] is True
      arr[j+1] = arr[j]
      Increment j = j + 1
Step6:Assign key at a[j+1]
Step7:Stop
